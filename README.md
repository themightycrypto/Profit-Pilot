# Profit-Pilot
<p>Hello, welcome to ProfitPilot!</p>
<p>I created this application because I really like using Profit Trailer. Also Feeder and Magic! ProfitPilot automates and enhances a lot of the combined power of the applications. It has a PT Feeder GUI, and also a ProfitTrailer GUI, which combined the two! It has many functions such as automatically translating your Trailer settings directly to Feeder! It also has manual buy & sell & manual DCA. 
 It can transfer your BTC or ETH profits to USDT or fiat when the market drops(Pro Version). It makes confguring separate coins easy! </p>
&nbsp;
