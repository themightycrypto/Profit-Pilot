# PT Co-Pilot
<p>Hello, welcome to PT Co-Pilot! 
 I created this add-on because I love using PT and feeder. I hope you find it useful.</p>
<p>PT-Co-Pilot automates and controls the combined power of Profit Trailer, Feeder, and Magic. It has a PT Feeder GUI, and a ProfitTrailer GUI which combines the two! It has many functions such as to automatically send your Trailer settings directly into Feeder! (it can also use PtMagic!) It also has manual buy & sell & manual DCA for Trailer. 
 It can transfer your BTC or ETH profits to USDT or fiat when the market drops(Pro Version). It makes confguring separate coins easy! </p>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>What does Co-Pilot do?</strong></p>

<p>Automatically saves settings to ProfitTrailer. No typing commands in ProftTrailer.</p>

<p>New PT Feeder user settings screen. (or also use PT Magic) </p>

<p>Monitor what Feeder is doing to Trailer.</p>

<p>Manual Buy and Sell in ProfitTrailer. Manual DCA also.</p>

<p>Automatically transfer PT settings into your Feeder file.</p>

<p>Easily configure separate coins instead of DEFAULT.</p>

<p>Connect to remote web interface and access using smartphone.</p>

<p>Transfer your BTC to USDT to save profits when the market drops!(Pro)</p>

<p>Works with ProfitTrailer or Feeder or Magic, or without Feeder or Magic. You do not have to get both.</p>

<p>And much more!</p>
